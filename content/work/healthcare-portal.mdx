## The Challenge

A healthcare provider needed a secure, compliant patient portal for appointments, results, and communications. The existing process was manual and did not scale across multiple clinics.

## Our System Approach

We followed our transformation framework with emphasis on governance and compliance:

- **Strategy & Consulting**: Scope and compliance mapping (data residency, consent, audit trails).
- **Technology & Software Engineering**: Patient-facing portal and clinic admin tools with secure authentication.
- **Automation, AI & Data**: Appointment reminders, result notifications, and reporting.
- **Media, Brand & Digital Growth**: Consistent patient communication and feedback loops.

## What We Built

- Patient portal with appointment booking, results view, and secure messaging.
- Clinic-side scheduling and resource management.
- Automated reminders and notifications with audit logs.
- Dashboards for occupancy, wait times, and patient satisfaction.

## Results & Impact

- Reduced no-shows and manual scheduling overhead.
- Single, compliant channel for patient communication.
- Clear visibility for operations and quality improvement.

## Continuation

We continue to support the client on a retainer for new clinics, integrations, and process improvements.
