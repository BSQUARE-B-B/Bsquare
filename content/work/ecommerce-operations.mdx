## The Challenge

An e-commerce operator needed to unify order management, inventory, and marketing across multiple channels. Manual processes were error-prone and did not scale with growth.

## Our System Approach

We applied our four-pillar model with a focus on automation and data:

- **Strategy & Consulting**: Process audit and integration roadmap (storefront, OMS, marketing tools).
- **Technology & Software Engineering**: Integration layer and internal tools for order and inventory sync.
- **Automation, AI & Data**: Workflow automation for orders, returns, and reporting.
- **Media, Brand & Digital Growth**: Performance marketing setup and attribution.

## What We Built

- Central order and inventory views with sync to storefronts and warehouses.
- Automated workflows for order confirmation, fulfillment, and returns.
- Dashboards for sales, inventory, and marketing ROI.
- Documentation for operations and future integrations.

## Results & Impact

- Fewer manual errors and faster order processing.
- Unified view of inventory and demand across channels.
- Data-driven decisions for restocking and marketing spend.

## Continuation

The engagement continues on a retainer for new channels, automation expansion, and optimization.
