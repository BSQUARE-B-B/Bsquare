## The Challenge

The client, a regional real estate group, needed a single system to manage multiple portfolios, listings, and lead flows. Legacy tools were fragmented and did not support clear reporting or compliance requirements.

## Our System Approach

We applied our four-pillar framework:

- **Strategy & Consulting**: Audit of existing tools and workflows; roadmap for consolidation.
- **Technology & Software Engineering**: Custom portal and CRM integration with documented APIs.
- **Automation, AI & Data**: Automated lead routing and reporting dashboards.
- **Media, Brand & Digital Growth**: Aligned listing presentation and lead capture with brand guidelines.

## What We Built

- Property and listing management modules with role-based access.
- CRM and email integration for lead nurturing.
- Dashboards for pipeline, conversion, and compliance metrics.
- Documentation and handover for in-house operations.

## Results & Impact

- Centralized operations with a single source of truth.
- Improved lead response time and visibility.
- Audit-ready processes for transactions and compliance.

## Continuation

The client remains on a retainer for ongoing optimization, new market rollouts, and feature enhancements.
