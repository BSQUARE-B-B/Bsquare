Effective automation requires governance: clear ownership, audit trails, and rollback paths. At CurveClear we design automation with these in mind so that scale does not come at the cost of control.

## Why governance matters

Automation that runs without visibility or approval workflows can create operational and compliance risk. We recommend defining owners, documenting triggers and outcomes, and building in review steps for high-impact actions.

## What we implement

- **Documented workflows**: Every automated process is documented with triggers, steps, and exception handling.
- **Audit logs**: Critical actions are logged for compliance and debugging.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Sensitive or high-impact steps require explicit approval before execution.
